# About Masque Blizzard Inventory

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-inventory "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masqueblizzinv), or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26503-MasqueBlizzardInventory.html).

This addon enables [Masque](https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masque), [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097-Masque.html)) to skin built-in WoW inventory elements.  It requires Masque to function and is configurable only with Masque's settings UI.  It can currently skin the following elements:

* Backpack
* Main Bags
* Combined Backpack
* Reagent Bag
* Bank
* Bank Bags
* Reagent Bank
* Guild Bank
* Void Storage
* Mail

Each element type is its own group so you can configure them independently.  The Combined Backpack will inherit the Backpack and Main Bags configuration.

If you like the Dragonflight UI improvements and don't want to use a bag or inventory mod, this is for you.  If you use an inventory mod that replaces the built-in UI, you won't get anything from this addon for any elements that have been replaced.  For example, if you are using a Bag mod but have not replaced the Guild Bank interface, this will still work for the Guild Bank.

If you're looking to skin the built-in action bars as well, check out [Masque Blizzard Bars](/kstange/MasqueBlizzBars) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-bars-revived "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masqueblizzbars), [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26502-MasqueBlizzardBars.html))!

I've done very limited testing with Wrath Classic because I don't play it, but I believe everything should work.  If you report bugs or submit patches, I'll do my best to address them.  Classic Era is not yet supported because some work is still needed.
