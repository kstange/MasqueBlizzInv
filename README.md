# About Masque Blizzard Inventory

This addon enables [Masque](https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masque), [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097-Masque.html)) to skin built-in WoW inventory elements.  An up-to-date version of Masque is required for it to work.

If you like the base WoW interface and don't want to use a separate bag or inventory mod, you're in the right place.

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-inventory "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masqueblizzinv), or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26503-MasqueBlizzardInventory.html).

## Features

Masque Blizzard Inventory can currently skin the following elements, according to your game version:

- Backpack
- Main Bags
- Combined Backpack
- Reagent Bag
- Bank (including Warband Bank)
- Guild Bank
- Mail
- Merchants
- Loot
- Character
- Inspect Character
- Equipment Flyouts
- Keyring (Classic only, before Cataclysm)
- Bag Bar (Classic only)

Each element type is its own group so you can configure them independently from Masque's Skin Settings.

The Warband Bank and Bank use the same inventory elements in Retail, so they share skin options as well.

An additional options panel is provided to hide background and slot artwork that might clash with certain Masque skins.

## Classic Support

Classic versions available in the US are fully supported. Elements not available in Classic will not appear in Masque's Skin Settings.

In Classic, all bags are consolidated to a single Bags group, including the Keyring. This is due to the way the game reuses Bag windows.

Most interface frames in Classic are built using a single background image, rather than multiple layers, so the options to hide background and slot artwork are not feasible.  Adding this feature would require drawing replacement artwork and including it with the addon, so it is not planned.

I don't play Classic so testing is somewhat limited, but I'll do my best to address bug reports promptly.

## Compatibility

This addon is intended to skin the base WoW interface. Addons that heavily modify parts of the base interface may conflict. If you experience a conflict, use Masque's Skin Settings to disable the affected group and reload your UI. This should allow the other addon to control the interface without interference.

If you'd like to see Masque support in a conflicting addon, try sending a feature request to that addon's author directly.
