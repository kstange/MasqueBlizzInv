# About Masque Blizzard Inventory

You can install this addon from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-blizz-inventory "CurseForge"), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masqueblizzinv), or [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26503-MasqueBlizzardInventory.html).

This addon enables [Masque](https://github.com/SFX-WoW/Masque) ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque), [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/masque), [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12097-Masque.html)) to skin the built-in WoW inventory windows.  It requires Masque to function and is configurable only with Masque's settings UI.  It can currently skin the following inventory UI:

* Backpack, Bags, Reagent Bag
* Bank, Reagent Bank, and Bags
* Guild Bank
* Void Storage

Each interface is its own group so you can configure the skin for each independently.

If you like the Dragonflight UI improvements and don't want to use a bag or inventory mod, this is for you.  If you do use Bagnon, you need [Bagnon Masque](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bagnon-facade) to achieve the same result, and you won't get anything from this addon.  Other addons that modify the inventory UIs may prevent this addon from functioning. If your UI is set up to leave some of the system inventory UIs intact, you should be able to safely use this alongside it.

I have not tested this with Classic or Wrath Classic, but if there's enough interest I may accept patches.
